# Missing Database Error Handling in Express.js User Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling when interacting with databases.  The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, which only handles the case of a user not being found.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
